To find the length of the hypotenuse (the long side) of a right triangle with side lengths 3 and 4 using the Pythagorean Theorem, we can use the following steps:

1. **Square both side lengths**: 
   - `(sqr 3)` calculates the square of 3. 
     - \( 3^2 = 9 \)
   - `(sqr 4)` calculates the square of 4.
     - \( 4^2 = 16 \)

2. **Add the squared values**: 
   - `(+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4))` adds the results of the two squares calculated above.
     - \( 9 + 16 = 25 \)

3. **Square Root**: 
   - `sqrt` takes the square root of the sum obtained in the previous step.
     - \(âˆš25 = 5\)

Putting it all together, the expression 

` (sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4))) `

When you run this code in a BSL environment, it will produce the value 5, which is the length of the hypotenuse for a right triangle with side lengths 3 and 4.
